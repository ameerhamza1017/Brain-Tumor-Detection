🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning
Brain tumor classification is a critical step in diagnosing and treating brain-related diseases. Manual identification and classification of brain tumors from MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans is often time-consuming and susceptible to human error.

This project presents a deep learning approach that accurately classifies brain MRI images into the following categories:

🎯 Glioma Tumor

🎯 Meningioma Tumor

🎯 Pituitary Tumor

🎯 No Tumor

The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture well-suited for image classification tasks.

📂 Dataset
The dataset comprises brain MRI images, each labeled with its corresponding tumor type. It serves as the foundation for training, validating, and testing the model.

🚀 Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing – Clean and prepare MRI images for model input.

Model Building – Design and implement a CNN architecture for classification.

Model Training – Train the CNN on the labeled dataset.

Evaluation – Assess model performance on a separate test set.
